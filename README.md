- 👋 Hi, I’m @LukeBel
- 👀 I’m interested in ... coding and building programs to better help me get a job in a field like video game design. I have a degree in Art and Animation and know how
to animate in Autodesk Maya and ToonBoom.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python, but have been told by many a sources to learn C++, which I have dabbled in but never really committed to.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... beginner projects to better understand how to apply coding to every day scenarios.
- 📫 How to reach me ... lukebelanger4@gmail.com, or check out my art and animation work at https://lukebelanger4.wixsite.com/animates
